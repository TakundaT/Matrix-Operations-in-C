## About the Project

This project is a command-line implemntation of a program that performs matrix operations in C. Please read the report pdf for more information. The matrices are generated randomly using time as a seed and different functions can be called to perform operations between multiple matrices

## Matrix Operations

1. Matrix Addition
2. Matrix Subtraction
3. Matrix Multiplication
4. Solve linear systems


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler like `gcc` installed. You can verify this by running:

```bash
gcc --version

# usage
first you need to run the `make` command in the terminal to build the files and the project structure.
After that, you can compile and run the code using this template:

Usage: ./math matrix nrows_A ncols_A nrows_B ncols_B <operation> [print]

where nrows_A (N1), ncols_A (M1), nrows_B (N2), and ncols_B (M2) represent the dimensions
of matrices A and B, and <operation> denotes the operation to perform ( add, subtract,
multiply, or solve ). Additionally, an optional print argument can be provided to print the
matrices A, B, and the result
